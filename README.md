# Economy Bot
Written by Dr Turtle

This bot is designed as a bot to pass the time with idle mechanics based around getting more money.

**Note. This bot is very much a WIP and is not ready for production usage.**

## Installation
1. Clone repository with `git clone git@gitlab.com:superturtle41/economybot.git`
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Either edit the batch file `run.cmd` with your token or add your token to the environment
5. Run the bot with the batch file or python bot.py

## Features I want to implement
1. Upgrades based on level
2. Maybe do a full 180 and turn this bot into an idle RPG (not likely but I can hope)
